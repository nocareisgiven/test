        <h2>â™¡ The Mysterious Disappearance</h2>
        <p><font size="3">Amelia Earhart's life took a tragic turn when, in 1937, she embarked on an ambitious flight around the world. During the final leg of her journey, Earhart and her navigator, Fred Noonan, disappeared over the Pacific Ocean.I think due to the weather being Amelia had to fly in high altitude causing her oil tank to get empty quickly.The air traffic controller tried connecting to her but couldn't even tho they were very near.After the crash no one knows what happened . While many theories still roam around I find the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coconut_crab">coconut crab</a> theory being quite believable to me .It indicates that she had been shredded to pieces by coconut crabs in a deserted island soon after the crash causing her death.</font></p>
